# Speech to Text Notes
Froom "getting-started" documentation (https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/getting-started):
You can batch long audio files for speech recognition (using Asynchronous Recognition requests) or have the Speech API listen to a stream and return results while the stream is open using a gRPC StreamingRecognize request. For example, a streaming recognition task may provide transcription from a user while they are speaking. See the Cloud Speech API Best Practices and Samples Applications for more details.
